# Pygame
I made 2 simple games using pygame.
One is snake, the popular game on brick phones.
The other is an original game I made where the aim is to kill all the slime. Similar to snake, there is no end goal to the game: the game ends once you die.
You need to have pygame installed to play the games.
I hope you enjoy playing them!
